# SOLID Design Pattern
**The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin, first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns discussing software rot.**
- [S] The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
- [O] The Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- [L] The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
- [I] The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
- [D] The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, not concretions."
