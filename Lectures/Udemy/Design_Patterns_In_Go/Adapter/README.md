# Adapter
**A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.**

## Summary
- Implementing the adapter pattern is easy.
- Determine the API you have and the API you need.
- Create a component which aggregates (has a reference to, ...) the adaptee.
- Intermediate representations can pile up: use caching and other optimizations.
