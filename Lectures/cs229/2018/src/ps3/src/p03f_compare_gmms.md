# Semi-Supervised(SS) vs UnSupervised(US)
## Training Iteration
SS shows less iteration to converge.

## Stability
Different initialization leads to different color cluster plot for each trial in US but stable in SS.

## Quality
SS Shows higher quality. SS plot show more accurate result based on the variance of the plot. 
(3 nearly the same low-variance Gaussian distributions, and a high-variance Gaussian distribution.)
