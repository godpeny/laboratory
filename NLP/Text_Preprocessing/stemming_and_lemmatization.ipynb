    "# Stemming vs Lemmatization\n",
    "## Stemming\n",
    " - a process that stems or removes last few characters from a word, often leading to incorrect meanings and spelling.\n",
    " - Stemming is used in case of large dataset where performance is an issue.\n",
    " - For instance, stemming the word ‘Caring‘ would return ‘Car‘.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lemmatization \n",
    " - a process that considers the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form, which is called Lemma.\n",
    " - Lemmatization is computationally expensive since it involves look-up tables and what not.\n",
    " - For instance, lemmatizing the word ‘Caring‘ would return ‘Care‘.\n",
